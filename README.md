# Machine Learning with Python

Several examples combining Python and Scikit.

* Requeriments (for Ubuntu; for Windows you'll have to visit each tool's homepage and download it):
 - Python (obviously)
 - Matplotlib
 - Scikit
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

Some data is probably missing. For instance, Apple data is not displayed in the plot. This probably deals with problems parsing each html file. However, it is a good example of how Python can help us to handle data with scykit and pandas.
